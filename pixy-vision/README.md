# Using Pixy2 with the stock WPILibPi image

Setup for this is rather tricky

First we need to build a version of libpixyusb2 that runs on the version of RPi linux we are using.

Instructions for that are here: https://docs.pixycam.com/wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:v2:hooking_up_pixy_to_a_raspberry_pi

Copy the resulting libpixy2.a file from build/libpixyusb2 to /usr/local/lib/libpixy2

Copy the pixy.rules file in this repo to /etc/udev/rules.d/

Note the one that comes with pixy2 does *not* work!

Copy the build_python3_demos.sh script to pixy2/scripts

Build the pixy2 python demos using python3 by running ./build_python3_demos.sh from the pixy2/scripts folder

### IMPORTANT

For python3 any .so file that gets generated by the pixy2 build must get renamed to _pixy.so
