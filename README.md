# 2022-Vision
This is the GearCats vision programming code for the 2022 FRC season. Vision processing is being implemented using a Raspberry Pi as a coprocessor, with one or two attached cameras.
We plan to use a Pixy 2 for ball tracking and possibly another webcam with a GRIP pipeline for shooter aiming using the retro-reflective targets.
